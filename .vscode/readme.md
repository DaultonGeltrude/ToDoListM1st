# My first markdown for the To - Do - List

For my first markdown document I am attempting to learn the light syntax to keep this formatted
additionally I want to document my testing process on a **bug**.

I stated by pressing F5 in VS Code, it said debug but I have no idea how that works so we're moving on!
Next I just tried to run my code in terminal.

Created a new Item called *test bug*.
Pressed option 3 to view list.
The item #0 test bug appeared
Pressed option 2 to delete item #0.
Pressed option 3 and item #0 was missing.

Added 4 new items 
All 4 items appeared
Deleted item #2
Other 3 items appeared in view.

Proceeded with pushing the md to git.
